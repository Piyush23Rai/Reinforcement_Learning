## 📊 What You're Seeing

### Training Curves Show:
- ❌ High costs initially (random policies)
- ✅ Costs decreasing over episodes
- ✅ Smooth improvement (moving average line)
- ✅ Final costs ~60% lower than initial

### What's Happening:
1. **Agents explore** → Random actions, high costs
2. **Agents learn** → Better actions, lower costs  
3. **Agents coordinate** → Implicit cooperation, even lower costs

## 🎯 3 Files to Know

### 1. maddpg.py (200 lines)
The algorithm. Contains:
- `SimpleActor` - Local policy
- `SimpleCritic` - Global value
- `MADDPGAgent` - Agent class
- `ReplayBuffer` - Memory

### 2. warehouse_env.py (80 lines)
The first environment. Shows:
- How to define state
- How to compute reward
- How agents interact

### 3. train.py (150 lines)
How to train. Shows:
- Training loop
- Evaluation
- Plotting results

## 🔧 One-Line Customizations

### More agents
```python
num_agents = 5  # Was 3 in line ~30 of train.py
```

### More training
```python
num_episodes = 500  # Was 200 in line ~27 of train.py
```

### Faster learning
```python
lr=0.01  # Was 0.001 in line ~65 of train.py (but may diverge)
```

### Stronger exploration
```python
epsilon = 0.2  # Start more exploratory in line ~91 of train.py
```

---

## ✅ You'll Know It's Working When:

1. ✅ No error messages appear
2. ✅ Progress bar moves smoothly
3. ✅ Completes in 2-3 minutes
4. ✅ PNG image appears at the end
5. ✅ Image shows downward cost trend

## ❌ Common Issues & Fixes

### "No module named torch"
```bash
pip install torch
```

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Runs forever
Something is wrong. Try:
```bash
# Kill the program (Ctrl+C)
# Reduce episodes in train.py
num_episodes = 10  # Test with 10 first
```

### Out of memory
```python
# In train.py
buffer = ReplayBuffer(max_size=1000)  # Was 5000
```

## 💡 What You're Learning

1. **MARL** - Multiple agents learning together
2. **CTDE** - Centralized training, decentralized execution
3. **MADDPG** - Deep reinforcement learning algorithm
4. **Coordination** - How agents learn to work together

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run it** - `python train.py`
2. **Understand it** - Read comments in code
3. **Modify it** - Change hyperparameters
4. **Master it** - Create your own environment

## 📈 Expected Improvements

### Warehouse
```
Cost: 250 → 100 (60% better)
```

### Banking
```
Reward: -25 → -8 (68% better)
```
